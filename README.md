HACKSC '14
Collaborators: Calvin Yin, Jasmine Kim, Walid Rahman

Calvin and Jasmine coded in mainly Javascript, HTML, and CSS to translate input given by the Thalmic Labs' Myo armband. A user can input morse code by either clutching to make a fist or extending fingers; clutching makes a short dot; spreading palm makes a long dash; swiping left sends the input. If the morse code is given as input, our website outputs English. If the user inputs words, it outputs the Morse code and sends vibrations accordingly to the Myo armband.

Walid worked on the flask-webapp to connect the messenger to the email system.
